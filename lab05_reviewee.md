2. A summary of the features of the product as you understood them, and what you liked or thought could be improved about each  
   * Current version allows users to login and signup. Could ask to verify password when signing up and add a forget password option to login. 
   * Current version doesn't have much in Learn More section. Could include maybe a brief summary for the user to understand the details behind investments.
   * Underlying investment algorithm works. Could add more detail to explain and visualizations to help, (graphs)

5. Your final closing thoughts: something you liked, the most impactful opportunity for improvement, and one more thing you thought was good.  
   * I liked that we have an underlying algorithm running in the backend doing all the work.
